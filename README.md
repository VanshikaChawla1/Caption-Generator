# Caption-Generator

The Caption Generator Agent is an interactive, AI-powered tool designed to help users generate creative and engaging captions for social media posts, blogs, or marketing campaigns. Built using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model and an intuitive ipywidgets-based interface, the tool provides fast and personalized caption suggestions tailored to a specific theme, tone, and audience.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
1. User-Friendly UI: Simple form-based interface using ipywidgets for seamless user input.
2. Customizable Inputs:
   -Theme â€“ Define the core topic (e.g., food, travel, fashion).
   -Tone â€“ Choose from multiple tones like Witty, Inspirational, Funny, etc.
   -Audience â€“ Specify the intended target group (e.g., Instagram followers, brand clients).
   -Hashtags â€“ Add any relevant hashtags to improve reach and engagement.
3. Fast Response: Utilizes the lightweight gemini-2.5-flash model to generate results instantly.
4. Character Limit: Ensures captions stay within 250 characters â€” perfect for platforms like Instagram or Twitter.

ðŸ§  How It Works:
